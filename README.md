Authors: Carina Tze, Sarah Wong, Sandra Radic

The domain of our application is a mentorship matching database.

This project uses MySQL database system, PHP, and HTML. We don’t expect to use any extra software or hardware.

## Project Description

The WiCS (Women in Computer Science) Mentorship Portal is an online resource for UBC students to meet other students through our mentorship program and/or explore event opportunities with industry professionals from our sponsor companies. To use our application, users are able to register as mentors or mentees and login to see their saved data, edit their profiles and view their mentorship match.
